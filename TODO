General:

. Asynchronous model (match_image_process.php)
. Only store mean/stddevs (as complete feature vector) and single complete gabor magnitude image in database.
. Consider changing binary/program format in database. Seems convoluted when more than one binary is required per algorithm (e.g. construct/compare gabor).
. Aggregrated ranking model to combine datasets (+ include weighting).
. Colour histograms are not textures, they are colour! Gabor analysis is texture!
. Ability to define scale/orientation when making gabor magnitude images.
. Add ability to type URL directly when generating textures/gabor magnitude images.
. Separate different histogram comparison methods (EMDL1, DD, INTERSECT) to different binaries - currently set in config.php.
. Both gabor magnitude image and texture creation should probably run concurrently (one page) so the same images have both features. Problem with this
  is the crop definition will differ for both. Would need two separate cropboxes.

Code:

. Not releasing images from memory.

Other Considerations:

. Maybe want to port the C source code to function with another lowel level language other than php.
