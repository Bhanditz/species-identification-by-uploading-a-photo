To setup the web front end:

1.	A web server must be running, e.g. Apache

	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/install.html

2.	PHP must be available on the web server:

	http://php.net/downloads.php

3.	The PHP GD library must be installed on the web server:

	http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php

4.	A softlink must be created from the local web server root directory to the www directory, this can be done by browsing to the server root, opening a terminal and executing:

	> ln -s /path/to/species-identification-by-uploading-a-photo/www species-identification-by-uploading-a-photo

5.	The permissions must be altered so the web user has ownership (in this case apache) of the images, textures, db and jobs directories. Open a terminal and execute from the base of the www directory:

	> chown -R apache images textures jobs db

	OR

	> chgrp -R apache images textures jobs db
	> chmod -R 664 apache images textures jobs db (directories must have read/write access)
