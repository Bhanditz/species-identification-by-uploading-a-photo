This requires the PHP GD library to be installed on the webserver.

Typically, I create a softlink in my local webserver directory to the www directory:

ln -s /path/to/species-identification-by-uploading-a-photo/www species-identification-by-uploading-a-photo

then I alter permissions so the webserver has ownership (in my case apache) of the images/ and textures directories, executed from the base of the www directory:

chown -R apache images
chown -R apache textures
