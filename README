To compile (requires OpenCV and GSL libraries) from a terminal, you must first edit the Makefile and add the corresponding include flags for the two libraries if they lie outside of your PATH. You can then you can execute:

./make match_texture


To execute

./match_texture image.jpg texture_1.jpg texture_2.jpg texture_n.jpg METHOD

where METHOD can be either INTERSECT or EMDL1

This will return a series of CSV numbers, quantifying how good the match is.
