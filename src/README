To compile the binaries on a linux machine:

1.	You must have the a c++ compiler installed, the default is g++ available from:

	http://gcc.gnu.org/

	Compilations using other compilers has not been tested.

1.	You must have the OpenCV and GSL libaries installed:

	http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
	http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

2.	Open src/Makefile with an editor:

	Point the INCLUDES path variable to the corresponding directories where the OpenCV and GSL headers reside (default is /usr/include/opencv and /usr/include/gsl).
	Point the LIB path variable to the corresponding directories where the OpenCV and GSL libraries reside (default is /usr/lib).

	Close the editor.

3.	From a terminal located within the src directory, execute:

	> ./make all

On success, this will place the binaries inside the bin directory.

For details on how to invoke each binary through the terminal, see the NOTES section in the corresponding binary source file.
